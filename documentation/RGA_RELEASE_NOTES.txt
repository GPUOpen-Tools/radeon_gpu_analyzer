Radeon GPU Analyzer 2.7.1 Release Notes
=======================================
Highlights
==========
-	Compile and analyze shaders and kernels for the AMD Radeon RX 7600 and 7700 series (gfx1102 architecture), even without a physical RDNA3™ card installed on your system.
-	DX12 mode: use the latest Shader Model features on any system with Agility SDK.
-	Relaxed DX12 .gpso input file content verification to permit empty InputLayout and RTVFormat elements.
-	Vulkan: New offline compiler, using AMD’s LLVM-based pipeline compiler.
-	Vulkan: updated the disassembler, fixing issue where certain 16-bit instructions were seen as “Unknown”.
-	OpenCL: fixed an issue that prevented Code Object binaries from being loaded by the runtime.

Notes:
In Vulkan Offline mode, --il and –pipe options are no longer supported as of version 2.7.1.


Known Issues
============
Vulkan Live Driver Mode
-----------------------
-	Source to disassembly correlation is not supported by AMD’s shader compiler and is therefore not supported in the UI.
-	Keyboard navigation is not supported from some views in the GUI application.
-	The RGA layer is a beta feature. It fails to extract the shaders and pipeline state from certain Vulkan apps.
-	Notifications about the fact that modified SPIR-V binary does not match the disassembly will not appear for loaded projects (in case where the user changed the SPIR-V code, did not build, and re-loaded the project).
-	The driver may generate empty shaders in case the user gives an invalid pipeline state or does not provide a pipeline state at all. This is expected to be fixed in an upcoming driver build and does not require modifications of the tool.


Offline OpenCL Mode
-------------------
-	OpenCL C++ kernels are not yet supported by the Lightning Compiler.
-	Cycle estimate for certain VALU instructions appears as “Varies” instead of 4.

OpenGL Mode
-----------
Resource usage statistics for OpenGL mode only displays usage of SGPRs and VGPRs.
=======
-	Cycle estimate for certain VALU instructions appears as “Varies” instead of 4.

DirectX 12 Mode
---------------
-	Live register analysis & CFG generation require using the --isa option to generate ISA disassembly. 
-	On Windows 11, Hull shader AMDIL disassembly contains a trail of a few garbage characters.

DirectX 11 Mode
---------------
-	Support for gfx1100 and beyond is not yet enabled in DX11 mode (-s dx11).

GUI Application
---------------
-	VGPR Pressure feature: certain instructions (image_* in particular) may report more live registers than actually used.
-	“Correlation Disabled” notification in the source code editor is not being saved for projects after they were closed.
-	Certain SALU instructions are being misclassified as VALU instructions. 
-	Certain GDS instructions are being misclassified as SALU.
-	Changing disassembly columns can be sluggish on certain systems in projects with multiple .cl files.
-	On systems with default Unicode path for the RGA projects folder, the tool will not be able to save files. A workaround has been provided in version 2.6.1 (allowing the user to change the folder in which projects are saved).

Notes for OpenCL Mode Users 
===========================
The Offline OpenCL mode uses the Lightning Compiler package that ships with RGA, which is based on clang.
As of version 2.0, RGA allows developers to replace the Lightning Compiler package that ships with the product with a user-provided LLVM-based package. For more information, see the Radeon GPU Analyzer GUI app's help manual, or run the command line tool with –s opencl –h as arguments (look for the “Alternative OpenCL Lightning Compiler” section).

System Requirements
===================
It is generally recommended to use RGA with the latest Radeon Software version. Specifically, to target the RDNA architecture, the latest Radeon Software version is required (except for all Vulkan® modes, OpenCL mode, OpenGL mode and DX11 mode which are independent of the driver).

Vulkan Mode
-----------
To use the installed driver in Vulkan mode:
a.	Vulkan SDK 1.1.97.0 or later is required.
b.	Latest Adrenalin or amdgpu-pro driver is required.

Vulkan Offline Modes (vk-offline, vk-spv-offline, vk-spv-txt-offline)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
All Vulkan offline modes (vk-offline, vk-spv-offline and vk-spv-txt-offline) are independent of the installed driver and graphics hardware and should work on any x86-based system.

DirectX 12
----------
It is recommended to use the latest Adrenalin drivers for the best experience in DirectX 12 and DirectX 11 modes.

DirectX 11
----------
DirectX 11 mode (-s dx11) is independent of the installed driver and graphics hardware and should work on any x86-based system.

OpenCL Mode
-----------
OpenCL mode (-s opencl) is independent of the installed driver and graphics hardware and should work on any x86-based system.

OpenGL Mode
-----------
OpenGL mode (-s opengl) is independent of the installed driver and graphics hardware and should work on any x86-based system.
