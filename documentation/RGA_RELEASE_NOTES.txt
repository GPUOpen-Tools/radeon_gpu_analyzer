Radeon™ GPU Analyzer 2.14 Release Notes
=======================================
Highlights
==========
-     Analyze precompiled HIP GPU Code Object binaries for the MI-350 (gfx950 CDNA™ 4 architecture) with RGA's Binary Analysis mode.
-     Compile and analyze OpenCL™ kernels for MI-350 (gfx950 CDNA™ 4 architecture).
-     Added support for the gfx1153 as a compilation target across all RGA's modes.

Notes: 
-     With the introduction of 25.20-based Linux drivers, the AMDVLK driver is no longer included in the amdgpu-pro driver package. This is a result of the AMDVLK open-source project being discontinued as mentioned here (https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMDVLK/discussions/416). Instead, the RADV open-source Vulkan® driver is installed by default. Consequently, live driver compilation of Vulkan pipelines using RGA is no longer supported with the latest drivers. For a limited transition period, RGA will still bundle the latest amdvlk64.so from the latest 25.10 amdgpu-pro driver release which can be used for reference. RGA will also continue to support Vulkan pipeline compilation on Linux through its offline Vulkan mode.
-     Clock cycle estimates are no longer presented by the upgraded ISA disassembly view in RGA GUI application.
-     The new disassembly view presents Functional Groups, leveraging the AMD GPU machine-readable ISA documentation.
-     For backward compatibility, the RGA CLI output presents Cycle estimates and Functional Unit fields similar to RGA 2.11. 
-     We are working on a revised performance estimate mechanism and will share more details in a future RGA release.

Known Issues
============
Vulkan Live Driver Mode
-----------------------
-	Source to disassembly correlation is not supported by AMD’s shader compiler and is therefore not supported in the UI.
-	Keyboard navigation is not supported from some views in the GUI application.
-	The RGA layer is a beta feature. It fails to extract the shaders and pipeline state from certain Vulkan apps.
-	Notifications about the fact that modified SPIR-V binary does not match the disassembly will not appear for loaded projects (in case where the user changed the SPIR-V code, did not build, and re-loaded the project).

Offline OpenCL Mode
-------------------
-	OpenCL C++ kernels are not yet supported by the Lightning Compiler.

DirectX 12 Mode
---------------
-	Live register analysis & CFG generation require using the --isa option to generate ISA disassembly. 
-	On Windows 11, Hull shader AMDIL disassembly contains a trail of a few garbage characters.
-	In offline mode, when the D3D debug layer is enabled (--debug-layer) debug output is not captured by the command line tool.

DirectX 11 Mode
---------------
-	Support for gfx1100 and beyond is not yet enabled in DX11 mode (-s dx11).

Vulkan Offline Modes (vk-offline, vk-spv-offline, vk-spv-txt-offline)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-	Vulkan offline modes will fail on Ubuntu 22.04. It will work as expected on Ubuntu 24.04.

GUI Application
---------------
-	VGPR Pressure feature: certain instructions (image_* in particular) may report more live registers than actually used.
-	“Correlation Disabled” notification in the source code editor is not being saved for projects after they were closed.
-	Changing disassembly columns can be sluggish on certain systems in projects with multiple .cl files.
-	On systems with default Unicode path for the RGA projects folder, the tool will not be able to save files. A workaround has been provided in version 2.6.1 (allowing the user to change the folder in which projects are saved).
-	On Linux, if the OS color theme is updated while the RGA GUI application is running, the RGA GUI application will not immediately reflect these changes (the changes will be reflected the next time that you launch the application).
-   Tooltips and Functional Groups are not supported for pre-RDNA targets.

General


Notes for OpenCL Mode Users 
===========================
The Offline OpenCL mode uses the Lightning Compiler package that ships with RGA, which is based on clang.
As of version 2.0, RGA allows developers to replace the Lightning Compiler package that ships with the product with a user-provided LLVM-based package. For more information, see the Radeon GPU Analyzer GUI app's help manual, or run the command line tool with –s opencl –h as arguments (look for the “Alternative OpenCL Lightning Compiler” section).

System Requirements
===================
It is generally recommended to use RGA with the latest Radeon Software version. Specifically, to target the RDNA architecture, the latest Radeon Software version is required (except for all Vulkan® modes, OpenCL mode, OpenGL mode and DX11 mode which are independent of the driver).

Vulkan Mode
-----------
To use the installed driver in Vulkan mode:
a.	Vulkan SDK 1.1.97.0 or later is required.
b.	Latest Adrenalin or amdgpu-pro driver is required.

Vulkan Offline Modes (vk-offline, vk-spv-offline, vk-spv-txt-offline)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
All Vulkan offline modes (vk-offline, vk-spv-offline and vk-spv-txt-offline) are independent of the installed driver and graphics hardware and should work on any x86-based system.

DirectX 12
----------
-	It is recommended to use the latest Adrenalin drivers for the best experience in DirectX 12 and DXR modes.
-	Please note that to enable the D3D12 debug layer (--debug-layer option), your Windows system must have the Graphics Tools feature installed (on Windows, go to Settings -> Apps -> Apps & features/Optional features). This is a D3D12 requirement which is unrelated to RGA.    

DirectX 11
----------
DirectX 11 mode (-s dx11) is independent of the installed driver and graphics hardware and should work on any x86-based system.

OpenCL Mode
-----------
OpenCL mode (-s opencl) is independent of the installed driver and graphics hardware and should work on any x86-based system.

OpenGL Mode
-----------
OpenGL mode (-s opengl) is independent of the installed driver and graphics hardware and should work on any x86-based system.
